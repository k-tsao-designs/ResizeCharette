		<p><span id="line1">Whether your next vacation is to a big city, the beach or someplace rural, why not make the trip more fulfilling by soaking up the destination’s culture?</span> <span id="line2">"Getting exposed to local culture is enriching and shows us a world beyond ourselves,”</span> <span id="line3">said Ashish Sanghrajka, the president of Big Five Tours and Expeditions,</span> <span id="line4">a Stuart, Fla.-based travel company specializing in custom cultural immersion trips.</span></p>

		<p><span id="line5">But he cautions that without thoughtful planning, a cultural getaway can be canned and touristy instead of authentic.</span><span id="line6"> Here are his top tips for taking a vacation with a true cultural sensibility.</span></p>

		<p><span id="line7">DITCH THE GROUP TOURS</span><span id="line8"> Group trips aren’t ideal for cultural immersion.</span><span id="line9"> “Group itineraries have a fixed agenda, so there’s little room to go off script, </span><span id="line10">and the more scripted a trip, the less authentic it is,” </span><span id="line11">Mr. Sanghrajka said. Instead, he suggests using a travel adviser </span><span id="line12">who is knowledgeable about the destination you’re interested in </span><span id="line13"> specializes in off-the-beaten-path cultural trips. </span><span id="line14">It’s also possible to build an itinerary by reading history and travel books and doing research.</span></p>

		<p><span id="line15">MINIMIZE PLANNED EXCURSIONS </span><span id="line16">Without set tours, you have more opportunities to discover the local culture in an organic way. </span><span id="line17">Instead of booking a culinary tour of Barcelona, for example, </span><span id="line18">book a guide through a local tour company who is well versed in food, </span><span id="line19">and ask this guide to take you to favorite restaurants and food markets. </span><span id="line20">Having an unspecified agenda has led to many rewarding cultural insights for Mr. Sanghrajka. </span><span id="line21">“My guides have invited me to their homes for dinner, </span><span id="line22">to weddings and to other outings where I saw how the locals really lived,” he said.</span></p>

		<p><span id="line23">Also, in developing countries, village tours, although popular, can be inauthentic. </span><span id="line24">Explore small villages on your own instead. </span><span id="line25">In Rajasthan, in India, for example, Mr. Sanghrajka likes staying in countryside properties and biking through the nearby villages.</span></p>

		<p><span id="line26">CHOOSE SMALL HOTELS THAT ARE LOCALLY OWNED</span><span id="line27"> Chains and large, splashy properties won’t give you a glimpse into the local culture, </span><span id="line28">but staying at a small hotel owned by locals and situated in a former home, historic building or residential part of town will. </span><span id="line29">Mr. Sanghrajka, for example, recently stayed at Saruni Samburu, </span><span id="line30">a safari camp in northern Kenya that is owned by a couple who live onsite and hire their staff from the local Samburu tribes. </span><span id="line31">Since such hotels don’t have big marketing budgets, you’ll have to do some legwork to find them </span><span id="line32"> — peruse travel blogs and books or ask a travel adviser.</span></p>

		<p><span id="line11">SKIP THE OBVIOUS BEACHES</span><span id="line33"> Steer clear of Caribbean destinations where cruise ships dock </span><span id="line34">and go for lesser-known islands and peninsulas where there are opportunities to partake in culture and enjoy the ocean, too.</span><span id="line35"> One example is Mancora, a town on Peru’s northwest coast, </span><span id="line36">which has good snorkeling and surfing but is also near Chulucanas, </span><span id="line37">a town known for pottery made with pre-Incan techniques.</span></p>
